# HMPPS Architecture Blueprint

## Background and Vision

>This formative document guides teams in delivering digital products and
>services into HMPPS. If documentation is missing or isn't clear, please [let
>us know](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C049XU1LR6W).

This user guide is for teams with applications or services deployed on, or
intending to deploy into HMPPS. It contains the blueprint for a reference
architecture which has been designed to accommodate most services which will
typically comprise:

* form based user input
* business logic
* storage of structured data

There may be justification for deviating from this reference architecture. If
a technical team believes that this is the case for their domain, they should
prepare a case for this deviation and discuss this with their assigned HMPPS
Digital Technical Architect or open a discussion with the TA community at
Slack Channel [#hmpps-technical-architecture](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CPT2USKRQ).

The HMPPS Digital provision is conceived as a multi-tier, event-driven
ecosystem of integrated services which help drive prison and probation
processes and enable staff to make informed decisions. Over time the
implementation of domain focused digital services will displace older
monolithic systems (e.g. [NOMIS][nomis], [OASys][oasys]) as the authority for
HMPPS administration and management.

[nomis]: ./documentation/reference/legacy-systems.html#nomis
[oasys]: ./documentation/reference/legacy-systems.html#oasys

All activity should follow the HMPPS and MoJ
[Architectural Principles](documentation/explanation/principles-overview.html)

We are business modelling and mapping to [HMPPS Domains](./documentation/explanation/domains.html)
based on the principles of Domain Driven Design

Specific user-facing services are built to a [service pattern](./documentation/explanation/service-technical-architecture.html)
that has been proven across multiple live services

We aim to choreograph business processes across services using [domain events](./documentation/explanation/domain-events.html)
to facilitate decoupling of teams and systems

## Tutorials

- [Setting up a new service](./documentation/tutorials/building-a-service.html) using the HMPPS template projects
- [Creating a hosting environment](./documentation/tutorials/creating-a-hosting-environment.html) using one of the MoJ hosting platforms
- [Designing your domain API](./documentation/tutorials/apis.html) according
  to HMPPS Digital standards

## How-To Guides

Common Components address cross-cutting concerns applicable to all domains.

Many common components are used across MOJ and are developed and supported by
either the HMPPS Development team, [Cloud Platform]() or [Operations Engineering][operations-engineering] or the

[operations-engineering]: https://operations-engineering.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/services.html#our-services

Those specific to HMPPS' needs are delivered by the **Core Components**
service area.

- [Authenticating users](./documentation/guides/user-authorisation.html) with your service using HMPPS Auth
- [Managing the source code](./documentation/guides/source-code-management.html)
  of your service
- [Adding monitoring and observability](./documentation/guides/monitoring.html) to your service
- [Adding business-level metrics]() to your service
- [Publishing domain events]() from your service
- [Logging activity](./documentation/guides/system-logging.html) in your service
- [Adding user access auditing](./documentation/guides/user-audit.html) to
  your service
