This user guide is for teams with applications or services deployed on, or intending to deploy into HMPPS Digital Prisons Service. It contains the blueprint for a reference architecture which has been designed to accommodate most services which will typically comprise:

* form based user input
* business logic
* storage of structured data

In some cases, there may be justification for deviating from this reference architecture. If a domain team believes that this is the case for their domain, they should prepare a case for this deviation and discuss this with their assigned HMPPS Digital Technical Architect or open a discussion with the TA community at Slack Channel [#hmpps-technical-architecture](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CPT2USKRQ).
