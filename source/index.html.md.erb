>This formative document guides teams in delivering products and services which make up Digital Prisons Service (DPS). If documentation is missing or isn't clear, please [let us know](mailto:richard.adams@digital.justice.gov.uk).

This user guide is for teams with applications or services deployed on, or intending to deploy into HMPPS Digital Prisons Service. It contains the blueprint for a reference architecture which has been designed to accommodate most services which will typically comprise of

* form based user input
* business logic
* storage of structured data

It is recognised that in some cases, there may be justification for deviating from this reference architecture. If a domain team believes that this is the case for their domain, they should prepare the case for this deviation and discuss this with their assigned HMPPS Digital Technical Architect or open a discussion with the TA community at Slack Channel [#hmpps-technical-architecture](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CPT2USKRQ~).

## DPS Vision

Provide a new suite of tools - or products - that enable our prisons to run better without NOMIS. Powered by accurate data and key insights.

## DPS Architectural Vision

The Digital Prisons Service (DPS) is conceived as a multi-tier, event-driven ecosystem of integrated services which help drive prison processes and enable prison staff to make informed decisions for prison operations.
