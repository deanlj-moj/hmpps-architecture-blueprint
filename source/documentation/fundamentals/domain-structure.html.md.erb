The digital service addressing a domain should contain all components necessary to manage the data owned by that domain. The default structure given below should be sufficient in most cases but alternative structures may be considered if required.

The **Front End Service** is a user interface providing facilities to view, create, manage and maintain the domain's data. It is likely that the front end service will require data from other domains and these may be retrieved by accessing their respective domain APis. All business-level actions undertaken by the user should be audited using [HMPPS Audit][hmpps-audit].

An **Orchestration Layer** may serve to organise the data required by the front end service into a readily consumable form. It is recommended that a dedicated service is deployed to contain this orchestration from the outset. If it is known that this will always be simple, a domain team may consider incorporating this orchestration into the front end service.

The **Domain API** is used by both this domain and by other domains to gain access to this domain's data.

**Subdomain Microservices** store and manage the domain's data. There is no hard and fast rule on how big or small these subdomains should be - they should be "just big enough".

The domain may need to react to an event - a business level change - lying outside it's scope of responsibility i.e. occurring in another domain. The other domain will publish such events to [HMPPS Domain Events][hmpps-domain-events]. It is the responsibility of this domain to listen out for  events it is interested in and react according.

Similarly, this domain should publish business level changes in it's data which other domains may listen out and react accordingly.

**Domain data** may be stored in single instance of a Cloud Platform provided AWS RDS PostgreSQL database. Procurement details maybe be found [here](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-terraform-rds-instance)
