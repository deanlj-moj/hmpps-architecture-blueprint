# Legacy Systems

## NOMIS

National Offender Management Information System (NOMIS) is the current
authority system for information management and administrations of HMPPS
Prisons. Developed by [Syscon](https://syscon.net/), it was originally
deployed into HMPPS xx years ago but is suffering from a number of constrains
typical for a system of this age:

As such a programme of work is underway to replace NOMIS with a new suite of
digital solutions.

## Delius

Delius (also known as nDelius for national Delius) is the main case/person
management system used by Probation Practitioners to manage people on
probation (community licenses).

### Technology

There are a number of APIs that can be used to access data stored in NDelius,
but it is recommended that in the first instance you post a message in
[#probation-integration-tech](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02HQ4M2YQN)

### Environments

- Dev (aka Test): https://ndelius.test.probation.service.justice.gov.uk
- PreProd: https://ndelius.preprod.probation.service.justice.gov.uk
- Prod: https://ndelius.probation.service.justice.gov.uk

In Prod, OASys and NDelius exchange Offender and Assessment data. This
integration is replicated in PreProd (ie PreProd NDelius and PreProd OASys
exchange data), however no such integration exists in Dev.

PreProd contains data copied and pseudo-anonymised from Prod - this is usually
refreshed monthly. As such Security Clearance is required to access PreProd or
Prod. There are no such restrictions on Dev.

## PPUD

Public Protection Unit Database (PPUD) is used for various Public Protection
purposes, including managing parole, managing recalls, managing mental health
transfers and managing serious complaints and incidents.

It is developed and supported by [Lumen](https://www.lumen.com/en-us/home.html). See
[PPUD](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARN/pages/4232904898/PPUD+and+OASys+overlapping+data)
for some useful context.

### Technology

PPUD is a .net + sql server application hosted (from July 2023) in the MoJ
Modernisation Platform

There is currently no API available to enable integrations with PPUD.

### Environments

- Dev (known as dev/test): https://internaltest.ppud.justice.gov.uk
- PreProd (known as UAT): https://uat.ppud.justice.gov.uk
- Prod: https://www.ppud.justice.gov.uk

UAT contains data copied and pseudo-anonymised from Prod - this is usually
refreshed 3/4 times each year. As such Security Clearance is required to access
UAT or Prod. There are no such restrictions on Dev.

There are no integrations between PPUD and any other service.


## OASys

Offender Assessment System (OASys) which manages most of the risk assessments
and sentence plans across both the Probation and
Prison Services.

Also see the [Assess Risks and
Needs](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARN/overview?homepageId=2358771974)
project.

### Technology

OASys is a Oracle APEX application hosted in MoJ's Azure fix-n-go environment.

There are a number of APIs that can be used to access data stored in OASys, but
it is recommended that in the first instance you post a message in
[#probation-integration-tech](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C02HQ4M2YQN)

### Environments

- Dev (known as T1): https://ords.t1.oasys.service.justice.gov.uk
- PreProd: https://pp-oasys.az.justice.gov.uk
- Prod: https://oasys.az.justice.gov.uk

In Prod, OASys and NDelius exchange Offender and Assessment data. This
integration is replicated in PreProd (ie PreProd NDelius and PreProd OASys
exchange data), however no such integration exists in Dev.

PreProd contains data copied from Prod - this is usually refreshed on a weekly
basis (on Sunday evenings). As such Security Clearance is required to access
either PreProd or Prod.

There are also additional environments, T2, Training and Practice that are used,
but can be ignored for most purposes.
