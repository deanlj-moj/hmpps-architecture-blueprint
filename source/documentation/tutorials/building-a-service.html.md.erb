## Microservices

### Purpose

A microservice should store, manage and maintain a closely cohesive set of
data within a domain - a subdomain.

### Construction

Built using the [Kotlin template project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-kotlin) as a base, the APi must align to [Government API technical standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards) and [DPS Microservice Guidelines]()

## User Interfaces

### Purpose

The user interface should enable users to maintain data within the domain. The
most popular browser in use within HMPPS is Microsoft Edge - user interfaces
should be tested against this browser.

### Construction

Built using the [Typescript template project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript) as a
base, the user interface must align to [DPS UI Guidelines]()

### User Audit

All business-level actions undertaken by the user must be audited using
[HMPPS Audit][hmpps-audit] common component.

### Security and Access

Staff-facing user interfaces must be secured using the
[HMPPS Auth][hmpps-auth] common component
