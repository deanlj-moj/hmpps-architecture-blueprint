# Hosting

By default, domain services should be hosted in MOJ's Cloud Platform.
Exceptions are possible of course but the team wishing to use alternative
hosting arrangements must prepare present their case to [HMPPS Lead Architects](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/C049XU1LR6W)
for scrutiny and approval.

Details on using MOJ Cloud Platform are available
[here](https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/)

Kubernetes Cluster.
