title: User Interface
---

# <%= current_page.data.title %>

## Purpose

The user interface should enable users to maintain data within the domain. The most popular browser in use within HMPPS is Microsoft Edge - user interfaces should be tested against this browser.

## Construction
Built using the [Typescript template project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript) as a base, the user interface must align to [DPS UI Guidelines]()
