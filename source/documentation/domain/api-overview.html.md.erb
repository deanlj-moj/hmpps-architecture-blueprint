## Documentation

All services should have clear API documentation that details the endpoints, parameters, response structure authorisation requirements and gives examples of use.

The API documentation should be in [OpenAPI 3][openapi3] format, according to [GDS guidelines][gds-guidelines]. It should include examples for the various data elements as well as the possible values for constrained items.

[openapi3]: (https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/main/versions/3.0.0.md)

## DNS

DPS project API URLs should have the suffix **.prison.service.justice.gov.uk**

## Mandatory Endpoints

### /health

All services must provide a **/health** endpoint which checks all dependencies are healthy (e.g. database connection) and returns a http status of 200 if everything is up and running. This endpoint is periodically called by DPS's Pingdom check which will send an alert to [#dps_alerts](https://mojdt.slack.com/archives/CP8FR9XL5) if an issue is identified. It is also called by [DPS Monitor](https://dps-monitor.prison.service.justice.gov.uk/health) to provide a dashboard of all the DPS services health.

### /ping

This simple check should return a http status of 200 if the service is up and running. It is suitable to be called by other services’ health checks and by kubernetes liveness and readiness probes if the application framework doesn’t provide specific endpoints.

### /info

This endpoint provides basic information about the current application version, github commit reference and other useful application information. This endpoint must return this data in a standard json response.
