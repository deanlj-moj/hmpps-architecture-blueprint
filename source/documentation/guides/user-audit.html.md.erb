# User Audit

This component is provided to enable domains to audit business-level user
activity. Domains may asynchronously send entries to HMPPS Audit which will
store them securely until needed. User interface services should post user
level activity entries to HMPPS.

It is not expected that user audit entries will be sent by back end domain
microservices as [system logging](system-logging.html) will provide sufficent
diagnostic information for these.
