# Prison's Approach

Prisons have identified set of high level products. Delivery teams are organised around these products in order that they can focus on delivering them in a shorter timescale by focussing on more holistic and better design not policy change to run prisons without NOMIS.

## Products

Products contain scopes of related requirements & functionality. An HMPPS Service Owner alongside their delivery teams is responsible for developing/procuring the digital components which address the business requirements of a product. This in turn enables HMPPS to wean itself off the NOMIS functionality which currently "addresses" those requirements.
