# User Interfaces

## Purpose

The user interface should enable users to maintain data within the domain. The most popular browser in use within HMPPS is Microsoft Edge - user interfaces should be tested against this browser.

## Construction

Built using the [Typescript template project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-typescript) as a base, the user interface must align to [DPS UI Guidelines]()

## User Audit

All business-level actions undertaken by the user must be audited using [HMPPS Audit][hmpps-audit] common component.

## Security and Access

Staff-facing user interfaces must be secured using the [HMPPS Auth][hmpps-auth] common component
