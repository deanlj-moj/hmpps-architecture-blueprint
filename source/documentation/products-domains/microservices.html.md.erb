## Purpose

A microservice should store, manage and maintain a closely cohesive set of data within a domain - a subdomain.

## Construction

Built using the [Kotlin template project](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-template-kotlin) as a base, the APi must align to [Government API technical standards](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards) and [DPS Microservice Guidelines]()
